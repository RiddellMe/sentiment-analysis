Cuz we're poor now because we dumped our life savings into.,0
to the moon confirmed ,1
If I was some rich hedge fund dude and I saw that reddit garbo I'd literally spend so much fucking money on a short position,0
Just remember y’all still refueling the boosters ,1
what with all the silver hate. clang gang has been a thing long before . it was based on inflation hedge from money printers and comex fuckery. the whole world doesn't revolve around short squeeze all of a sudden.,0
"Gamma squeeze, momentum, mass media attention, elon musk tweeting, chamath announcing he bought otm calls. Really only reason we dropped was RH and others restricting buying.",1
Textbook fud spamming account for everybody to take a look at. This is what it's come to,0

I’m willing to long term this hold just to see the  turnaround story.  And to watch the potential for serious mooning on the rocket ship  haven’t gone away.,1
"This ad made me feel really good. I was feeling down that the  hype died, but this makes me hope we can continue to push back :') Im still going to the moon boys one way or another ",1
Sounds like you're going out of your way to bash GME and giving an opinion that is intentionally against the grain,0
If your still in  you are the fabled bagholders. That run is over.  is only going to go down from here. Sorry for ya.  Let the butthurt down votes  commence!,0
"I will be fine. There are a lot of eyes on the  situation, including a new president who needs to prove he is on the side of the populace. There is also a lot of instability in the US (how many riots have there been over the last few months). I would be ill-advised for institutions to do something that can be proven criminal as they would be a great scalp."", ""Agreed. Will be interesting to see when / if the  millionaires start buying back in. I figure it won't go below $30, but will also have. A hell of a time getting above $70, short of call options Gamma and delta hedging. (though, at those premiums, substantial volume isn't likely until Friday)",0
"Whenever I go for a short term investment, I put in a sell order at 10 to 20% higher immediately after purchase as a ""set and forget"" gain. I got greedy with  and put a sell in for $5k. I would have made my 20% within hours if I did my normal strategy and instead lost 80%. Oops",0
"Lol I tried to tell them that same thing (among other stuff) in a post last week, decided to delete it after the mass hate mail I was getting. Fucking morons. Just let them lose all their money chasing the particles of this already-popped bubble as they crash into the ground, that's what I say. The saddest part was a guy who messaged me saying thanks for pushing him to finally sell when it was around 90-100. Told me his friend had convinced his family to dump their retirement account into GME when it was at 300. They had lost 30 of their 40k savings and his family was debating whether to sell or hold to wait for ""the big squeeze"" and recoup their losses. Just terrible.",0

So my  calls are double fucked tomorrow - got it,0
 car talks not going well,0
It'll likely take a hit. I think the talks are there but  did not want it revealed this early so they're walking back the hype,0
"The levels of recklessness and exposure are getting too high for something like this sub to be sustainable. Whether they manipulated or not the squeeze is covered. They will deal with repercussions with regs later. People are posting about 'Averaging down' LOL Meanwhile people follow a cult of personality that makes the early WSB days look like childs play. The only way to combat the Q level conspiracy shit is to tell people they are flat out wrong and give supporting facts as to why. The differentiator between this pump and legitimate DD from the past is that people took the time to understand the market forces at play, and their level of personal risk tolerance.  A small few were throwing their retirement accounts into  and biomed companies to play earnings and drug releases. Now, its a ton of newbies throwing a retirement account into  and saying guh. An inverse WSB ETF would generate steady gains.",0
